    "content": "<p>You have two soups, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, each starting with <code>n</code> mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen <em>at random</em>, each with probability <code>0.25</code> <strong>independent</strong> of all previous turns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B</li>\n\t<li>pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B</li>\n\t<li>pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B</li>\n\t<li>pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.</li>\n\t<li>The amounts from A and B are poured <em>simultaneously</em> during the turn.</li>\n\t<li>If an operation asks you to pour <strong>more than</strong> you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The process stops immediately after any turn in which <em>one of the soups</em> is used up.</p>\n\n<p>Return the probability that A is used up <em>before</em> B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the<strong> same turn</strong>.
